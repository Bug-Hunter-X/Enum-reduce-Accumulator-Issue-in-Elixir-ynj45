This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Elixir's Enum.reduce function. The bug arises from an incomplete handling of the accumulator variable within the anonymous function passed to Enum.reduce.  The provided code attempts to sum elements greater than 2. However, it fails to properly handle cases where elements are less than or equal to 2, unintentionally modifying the accumulator. The solution provides a corrected version with a more robust accumulator handling.
